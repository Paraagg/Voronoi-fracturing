# Voronoi-fracturing
This project aims to implement a method for mesh fracturing which allows for unique results and dynamic impact locations. The same was implemented as a tool for Maya using MayaCMDS, PySide and Python.

Destruction and formation of objects in computer graphics often has its workflow defined keeping in mind a specific goal. It usually involves simulating detailed physics with material study, at the same time forces that might cause fractures and fragments can be time-consuming and demands large processing power. The idea of Voronoi Mesh Fracturing is to target specific types of materials, which are brittle and ductile.d Python.
